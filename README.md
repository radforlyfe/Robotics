### 1) Markov Decision Process
The objective of this lab was to explore Markov Decision Processes (MDP) by developing and implementing a model of simple discretized robot behaviour in 2D grid world and using it to accomplish some prescribed tasks (goal state). The goal was to find the optimal policy (set of best actions for each state) that maximizes the expected sum of rewards.

### 2) Path Planning
The objective of this lab was to build autonomy into a simple two-wheeled non-holonomic robot. The robot occupies a space of 90mm X100mm and has two wheels of given radius separated by a given distance. We implemented sampling based planning algorithm such as Rapidly-exploring-Random-Tree (RRT) and RRT* (optimized RRT) to get our robot to a desired state.

### 3) Kalman Filter
The objective of this lab was to estimate the state of a simple two-wheeled non-holonomic robot with realistic hardware using extended kalman filter (EKF). We develop and implement a mathematical model of the robot sensor and actuator behaviour and use it to evaluate a state estimation algorithm.
